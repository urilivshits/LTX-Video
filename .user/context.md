- **[Architecture Pattern]** Implemented [pattern name] for [purpose] to enhance [benefit].
- **[Framework Selection]** Adopted [Framework Name] for [component] to improve [benefit].
-->

- **[Repository Structure]** Organized the codebase with clear separation of model components, pipelines, schedulers, and utilities to enhance maintainability and extensibility.
- **[Model Architecture]** Implemented a DiT-based video generation model focused on real-time performance while maintaining high quality output.
- **[Pipeline Design]** Created flexible pipeline architecture supporting multiple input modalities including text-to-video, image-to-video, and video extension.
- **[Workflow Structure]** Developed modular workflows in USER_DIR (image-to-video, video expander) demonstrating different capabilities, with prompt enhancement integrated directly into the relevant workflows.
- **[Dependency Management]** Established clear dependency structure with requirements.txt for simplified installation across environments.
- **[Seed Management]** Implemented hybrid seed derivation that balances consistency with diversity across multi-segment video generation.
- **[API Compatibility]** Ensured workflow scripts maintain compatibility with the LTX-Video model pipeline API constraints.
- **[Parameter Organization]** Structured configurable parameters with clear grouping and documentation to enhance usability and discoverability.
- **[Prompt Enhancement Strategy]** Implemented word-aware truncation for enhanced prompts to preserve meaningful content within character limits.
- **[Multi-segment Enhancement]** Added optional capability to enhance prompts for all video segments independently using segment-specific image analysis.

## Implemented Features
<!--

- **[Feature Name]** Developed functionality for [purpose] that enables users to [capability].
- **[Optimization]** Enhanced [component] performance by [technique] resulting in [benefit].
-->

- **[Text-to-Video Generation]** Developed functionality for converting text prompts into high-quality video that enables users to generate video content from descriptive prompts.
- **[Image-to-Video Generation]** Implemented conditioning on images that enables users to animate still images with coherent motion.
- **[Video Extension]** Added capability for extending existing videos both forward and backward that enables users to lengthen video content seamlessly.
- **[Multi-Condition Generation]** Developed support for multiple conditioning inputs that enables users to control video generation using multiple reference images or video segments.
- **[Automatic Prompt Enhancement]** Implemented automatic enhancement of short prompts that enables users to get better results from minimal descriptions.
- **[Video Expansion]** Created workflow for generating longer videos by chaining multiple generations together, using the last frame of each segment as the starting point for the next segment.
- **[Segment Concatenation]** Implemented smooth transitions between video segments with crossfade effects to create seamless extended videos.
- **[Subject Consistency]** Added multiple techniques for maintaining subject appearance across video segments, including image regression, frame selection, and conditioning controls.
- **[Temporal Prompting]** Enabled segment-specific prompts to maintain narrative coherence across expanded videos while allowing for scene progression.
- **[User Experience]** Enhanced parameter documentation with clear explanations, recommended values, and usage examples to improve usability.
- **[Prompt Logging]** Added detailed logging of final prompts used for each video segment to improve transparency and debugging.
- **[Prompt Truncation]** Improved prompt handling to truncate at word boundaries rather than character limits to preserve readability.
- **[Multi-segment Prompting]** Added ability to enhance prompts for all video segments or just the first segment based on user preference in the video expander workflow.
- **[Integrated Enhancement]** Merged dedicated enhanced workflow into the main image-to-video workflow (03_image_to_video_diffusers.py) for streamlined usage.

## Resolved Bugs
<!--

- **[Bug ID/Description]** Fixed [issue description] in [file-name.js]
- **[Bug ID/Description]** Resolved [issue description] affecting [component/feature]
-->

- **[Frame Type Handling]** Fixed frame type handling issue in 04_video_expander_diffusers.py that was causing errors when saving PIL Image objects
- **[Video Generation Process]** Enhanced video generation pipeline to properly handle different frame formats across multiple expansion segments
- **[Last Frame Processing]** Fixed bug in video expansion workflow where the conversion of the last frame was failing between segments
- **[Subject Degradation]** Resolved issue with subject appearance degrading across multiple video segments by implementing image regression and improved frame selection
- **[API Compatibility]** Fixed runtime error in video expander by removing unsupported conditioning_scale parameter from pipeline call
- **[Prompt Truncation]** Fixed issue where enhanced prompts were being cut off mid-word by implementing word-aware truncation
- **[Segment Prompt Clarity]** Resolved ambiguity about which prompt was being used for each segment by adding explicit logging

## Documentation Updates
- **[Documentation]** Updated README.md with new options and finalized project documentation artifacts
